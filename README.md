# Life_plus
My entry for Swift Student Challenge 2024
Life+ is an emergency first aid guide app which aims to help people to help themselves and
others in times of need. It utilizes SwiftUI for its interface, keeping the UI minimal and intuitive.
Key features include a tab view structure with a comprehensive yet easy to understand first aid
guide offering video demonstrations, text descriptions and injury causes. AVKit integrates video
playback within the guide, enhancing the usability of the app. Leveraging ContactsUI, users
can easily add emergency contacts to their profile directly from their iPhone contacts.
PlaygroundSupport in Xcode playgrounds enables rapid swift development and iteration. These
technologies combine to create a practical platform, equipping users with essential life-saving
knowledge and functionality, fostering confidence during emergencies.
